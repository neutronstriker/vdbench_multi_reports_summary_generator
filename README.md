# vdbench_multi_reports_summary_generator
Vdbench is a utility for generating synthetic IO workload for block storage devices and can be used for bench marking performance of a storage device.

If you have recently collected lots of VDBENCH reports for analysis this tool can help you generate a single summary sheet by analyzing all those reports. All you need to do is keep the .exe or the .py file in that folder and run it. Try "--help" to know more about it.
